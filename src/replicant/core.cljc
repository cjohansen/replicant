  "Beware! This code is written for performance. It does a lot of things that can
  not be considered idiomatic Clojure. If you find yourself looking at it and
  asking \"why are things done like that?\" the answer is most likely
  \"performance\". With that out of the way...

  To postpone as much processing as possible, Replicant uses three separate
  representations of the DOM:

  ## hiccup

  This is whatever the consumer uses to express the DOM structure of their
  components. This format is very permissive and is designed to be convenient to
  work with. In hiccup, the attribute map is optional, tag names are keywords,
  and can even include id and classes, like a CSS selector. Because of its
  leniency, replicant must process it to work with it.

  ## hiccup \"headers\"

  Hiccup \"headers\" is a partially processed version of the hiccup. It gives
  access to the string tag name, and key, if any. This version is used to make
  decisions about the hiccup being rendered - is it an update to existing nodes
  or new nodes, etc.

  For performance, hiccup headers is a positional tuple, and in CLJS even a
  native array. Individual values are accessed through some macros for
  readability, whithout sacrificing performance.

  The tuple contains raw hiccup children. `get-children` returns a structured,
  flattened representation of all children as hiccup headers.

  ## vdom

  vdom is the fully parsed representation. This format is only used for
  previously rendered hiccup. Hiccup must be fully processed to actually be
  rendered, and Replicant keeps the previously rendered vdom around to speed up
  subsequent renders.

  vdom is another positional tuple (and native JS array in CLJS), and has
  similar macro accessors as the hiccup headers."

  optional. This function finds the important bits of the hiccup data structure

  Attributes and children are completely untouched. Headers can be used to
  quickly determine tag name and key, or sent to `get-attrs` and
  `get-children` for usable information about those things.

  Returns a tuple (instead of a map) for speed.
